**Overview**

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental algorithms in Python:

**Randomized Quicksort**

A sorting algorithm that selects a random pivot for partitioning.

Recursively sorts subarrays to produce a fully sorted list.

Random pivot selection improves performance on datasets with patterns.

The repository also includes a report analyzing the algorithms’ theoretical and empirical performance.

**Hash Table with Chaining**

Stores data in key-value pairs.

Handles collisions using chaining (each index holds a list of elements).

Supports the following operations: insert, search, and delete.
